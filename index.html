            <h1>PLEASE STOP USING THIS DOMAIN!!!!!!</h1>
            <t>I recently found out that the company that I got this domain from has a history of screwing over domain users by "stealing" the domain.</t>
		</t>IF YOU'RE USING SOME OTHER DOMAIN, SUCH AS BLOODRED.PAGES.DEV, THEN PLEASSE NOTE THAT THIS WEBSITE IS BEING MOVED TO A DIFFERENT DOMAIN!</t>
